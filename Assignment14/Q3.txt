What are loops, and whay do we need them? Explain different types of loops with their syntax and examples.

A-Loops are  allow you to repeat a set of instructions multiple times, making it easier to perform repetitive tasks or iterate over collections of data. They are crucial for automating tasks and efficiently handling repetitive operations in code.

Why Do We Need Loops?
Efficiency: Loops help avoid duplicating code, making programs more concise and efficient.
Automation: They automate repetitive tasks, saving time and effort.
Iteration: Loops allow you to iterate over arrays, lists, or other data structures to process each element.
Dynamic Behavior: They enable dynamic and flexible control flow in your code.

There are several types of loopsome of them are for , while , do while

1. For Loop:-A for loop is used when the number of iterations is known in advance.

syntax:-for (initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {}
Example:-for (let i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
    console.log(i);
}

2. While Loop:-A while loop is used when the number of iterations is not known in advance, and it continues executing as long as a specified condition is true.

syntax:-while (condition) {}

Example:-let i = 1;
while (i <= 5) {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
}

3. Do-While Loop:-A do-while loop is similar to a while loop, but it always executes the code block at least once, even if the condition is initially false.

syntax:-do {
} while (condition);


Example:-let i = 1;
do {
    console.log(i);
    i++;
} while (i <= 5);
